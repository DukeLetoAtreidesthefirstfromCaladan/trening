                <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInRightBig wow">We have accumulated our experience in living, working and surviving since 2014 in the most severe conflict of the century in Europe â€“ Ukraine. We are proud to share our knowledge and experience with INGO and NGO staff, media workers, community-based organizations and government institutions. Our team has no limits and restrictions in delivering humanitarian aid, providing security trainings (Hostile Environment Awareness Training/Hostile Environment Individual Safety Training, Field First Aid, Mine Risk Education, Active Shooter, Kidnapping and Hostage Taking Survival), PSEAH and Safeguarding Trainings as well as Third-Party Monitoring services (Phone Surveys, Focus Group Discussions, Key Informants Interviews, Face-to-face surveys) and a lot more according to your demands.
                    We are flexible, result-oriented and able to adopt to any reasonable requirements.</p>

                <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInLeftBig wow">Experience of our staff in providing security for INGOs and international media, supported by professional medical instructors and psychologists, results in high-level trainings for those who would like to increase their surviving chances in the military conflict in Ukraine. 4-day-long real-life training, with simulations, role-played games, a lot of outdoor exercises and classroom lectures allows people with minimum understanding and experience to gain a hands-on practice in casualty care and extreme situations behavior, communications, incident reporting, Road Traffic Incidents and kidnapping/hostage taking survival.</p>

                <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInLeftBig wow">We teach our students how to apply their Individual First-Aid Kit items (and we can advise on the IFAK content), how to deal with stress and how to prevent burn-out. We deliver CPR (Cardiopulmonary resuscitation) training and how to deal with other traumas, both combat-related and the ones they can meet in ordinary life. We train how to avoid minefield and how to be if they got into one, how not to rage your abductors and to survive if Active Shooter appears on the scene, how to care of Road Traffic Incident survivor and how to call for help, as well as other survival practices based on experience of daily working on the frontline in Ukraine.</p>
